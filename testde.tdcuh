Potential Solutions
Several approaches were mentioned in the thread that helped different users:

Git repack: Running git repack -adf at the project root fixed the issue for some users.
Worktree approach: One user solved it by creating a non-sparse worktree near their sparse one, running git lfs pull there, then returning to the sparse worktree and running git lfs pull again.
Fix path issues: One user mentioned the problem occurred when using relative paths for alternate object directories. Changing to absolute paths resolved it.
Repository recreation: In extreme cases, users had to recreate repositories from scratch and import all the tags.
Avoid symlinks: One user noted the issue happened only when inside a symlink to a subdirectory of the git repo.

If you're experiencing this issue, I'd recommend trying these solutions in this order:

First run git repack -adf as it's the least invasive solution
If using worktrees or symlinks, try the specific fixes for those scenarios
As a last resort, recreate the repository

The root cause seems related to Git LFS not properly finding or accessing objects, but varies by specific environment and configuration.
